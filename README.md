# cell-drawings
Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my little gallery of immune cell illustrations — hand-drawn and shared with the scientific community.

I'm Gonzalo Borrego-Yaniz, and I created these drawings to make my presentations a bit more visual and fun. I decided to share these cell illustrations I use in case others find them helpful — especially if you enjoy a friendly style or don’t have access to paid illustration software.

Feel free to use them in your presentations, papers, posters, lectures... wherever a cheerful immune cell might come in handy! No citation needed.

I’ll keep adding more as I go, I usually draw them when I need them myself 🧪✨

Thanks for visiting! 🔬
